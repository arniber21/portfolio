    Hi, I'm Arnab. I build reliable software systems with an emphasis on
    <span class="accent-text text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-200">programming languages and formal methods</span>,
    then carry those ideas into practical tools that people can actually ship and use. I care a lot
    about correctness and mathematical elegance, but also about systems that feel good to use: clean interfaces, sharp developer workflows, and
    systems that stay maintainable as they grow.
