To the enthusiast, artificial intelligence signals the onset of a technological revolution worthy of a new industrial revolution. To the environmentalist, artificial intelligence has reset decades of progress in renewable energy. To the artist, artificial intelligence has perpetrated the greatest legal theft of intellectual property in the history of the modern world. To the frontiersman pushing the field forward and the policymaker attempting to curb its negative externalities, artificial intelligence is a challenge the likes of which have never before been seen. By exacerbating the climate crisis, facilitating the spread of disinformation, and threatening the total replacement of human capital, artificial intelligence has the capacity to decimate modern society if not built and regulated in a thoughtful manner. 

Artificial intelligence, following a long line of industrial innovations, significantly threatens our progress towards mitigating climate change. The large processing power required to train and use large-scale machine learning systems, particularly for large language models, uses up electrical energy on the scale of countries. Any increase of consumption at such a scale significantly scales the quantity of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Conservative estimates place the energy required to train large language models such as ChatGPT at around 936 megawatt-hours - enough to power over a thousand households for a year. The widespread dissemination of artificial intelligence-powered functionality has skyrocketed usage further, scaling its energy usage many orders of magnitude. Additionally, the cooling for these massive AI data centers often carries inadvertent environmental effects: pumping hot water into natural freshwater ecosystems threaten both the biodiversity of the marine ecosystems and compromises its potential as a supply of freshwater. In an optimistic world, this demand could lead to nuclear energy as a solution to efficiently power AI data centers (re: Microsoft, Meta, Google). The re-introduction of nuclear power into the energy mainstream holds the potential to accelerate the green energy transition by an exponential magnitude, erasing decades of backward progress caused by nuclear fear-mongering and potentially leading to a greener future. We are far from such a utopia, however; most estimates optimistically hazard wide-scale nuclear adoption for AI data centers at around a decade, for which we will continue to burn massive amounts of fossil fuels. 

Artificial intelligence has added a seemingly insurmountable dimension to the dissemination of intentionally misleading information online. Prior to the AI revolution, online disinformation ran amok: cell-phone scams targeting the elderly, false political posts designed to spread outrage, and much more. However, previously, it was feasible for one to reasonably discern such content from truthful content. Artificial intelligence has become so effective at creating intentionally dishonest content that it is no longer possible for even digital forensic experts to detect and identify misinformation. Deep-fake videos and images, for example, allow malicious actors to create eerily realistic false media, which is often used to reinforce intentionally misinformed political content. Previously, this content would rarely strike a tone due to a clearly identifiable "conspiracy" element or otherwise, allowing most digitally literate individuals to discard the information. Rather, this propaganda usually thrived on sites such as Facebook, where media literacy is lacking. The effectiveness of deep-fake obfuscates even the judgement of the digitally literate individuals will struggle to decide if what they are seeing is conclusive proof or false evidence. When echoed and amplified to larger audience by high-profile individuals, the damage can be irreversible. Such misinformation was particularly damaging in social-media coverage of the Israel-Hamas war of 2023 and the Ukraine-Russia war of 2022. The dangers of AI-generated content extend far beyond deepfakes - child and revenge pornography, false voice scams, AI-generated SEO farms, and more all compromise the integrity of information on the internet in irreversible ways. Ironically, this massive influx of AI-generated misinformation may prove to be the bane of future AI development: training AI on AI-generated content corrupts the output. In the current stage of AI development where models are quickly growing to fit larger and larger amounts of training data, filtering out AI-generated content from training datasets has proven to be a significant problem. 

The most dangerous implication of artificial intelligence is the total replacement of human labour. In the past, technological advancement always augmented human labour, allowing us to become more effective and efficient at those jobs. Still, the ability to perform these jobs were locked behind human operation. For better or worse, society runs on economic output. For an individual, this is determined by their job. Therefore, as long as can work in some way or the other, they can create the economic value required to simply exist in society. The premise of every individual providing some value is the true driver of social mobility, and what separates the feudal system of pseudo-slavery from our current market-driven society. While artificial intelligence may not currently pose the ability to replace jobs altogether, it certainly holds that threat. Companies such as Klarna are already attempting to leverage AI to replace the role of employees. Unfortunately, if artificial intelligence ever develops to a level where it is able to replace any human at a given task, the free market dictates that companies will immediately seek to replace these laborers with AI. As the cost of compute decreases, this trend will only entrench itself further. What will result is a society where economic value is placed not on the individual but the machine, exacerbating wealth inequality on a scale unimaginable even in the digital gilded age we live in. With the exception of the oligarchs who control the machines for which they work, man will find himself in an ever-increasing position of poverty until society collapses under the weight of its own greed. While many have predicted that government reaction in the form of social programs would prevent such disaster for occurring (and potentially usher in a form of utopia), government action has proven to be extremely lethargic compared to the lightning-quick pace of development of AI. In the past, the electorate has been quite allergic to such social nets. Additionally, businesses and those who control significant amounts of capital will only stand to gain from such a dystopia, and these individuals hold an increasingly powerful position quickly eclipsing that of the common man. 

It would be incorrect to solely characterize artificial intelligence as a force of evil. Its impact has advanced progress in medicine further than ever before, powering numerous advances that project to increase the average lifespan of man. However, it is also very apparently more dangerous than any technology that has come before it. Proper legislation and safety measures from adversarial AI are crucial if we are to mitigate the absolutely catastrophic harms that AI has already wrath on the digital landscape. This pursuit needs not be purely altruistic - commercial ventures into compliance and audit measures paired with strict safety requirements from governing bodies can result in the sustained development of secure and effective AI while preventing the proliferation of adversarial and harmful AI. Man has opened Pandora's Box, and must live with the demon it has created while holding onto hope for a safer and more secure future.
