It took me a long time to learn to ride a bike, three years to be exact. But when I did, I gained my greatest passion and my favorite pastime. While objectively my greatest skill is the ability to solve abstract problems, I would argue that biking is just as important because of the way that it clears my mind of all of my entanglements. On the road, the only thoughts that rummage through my mind are the gentle hum of my tires on the asphalt and the wind blowing past me. Biking allows my mind the clarity and freedom to think creatively.

Before starting high school, we lived in Colorado until both my parents lost their jobs simultaneously. Following the news, I began to bike more often, for longer periods of time, over further distances. Long-distance biking is strenuous - for more than the body. Through those long bike rides - running thirty, or forty miles long and lasting hours of my afternoons, I began to take comfort in solitude. It’s easy to lie to yourself, especially in tough situations like the one my family was in, but out alone on the road when the hill causes your shins to burn and there’s nothing else to distract you, it’s difficult to tell your inner voice something you know is false. 

We moved to California for my parents’ new jobs, and biking became my source of exploration. Moving to California felt like going from a small world to a big one, and it was on two wheels that I got to know my new world. As I crossed street after street and began to ingrain the map of Orange County in my mind, California shifted from a large nebulous beast that I knew nothing about to something akin to a small community. My newfound sense of exploration allowed me to meet countless people - many of whom became good friends, best friends even. 

As I venture out from high school into college and beyond, I know there will be a bike involved. Through life’s twists, turns, hills, and peaks, I’ve conquered them all on two wheels, and that shall never change no matter where I go.
