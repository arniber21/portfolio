Artificial intelligence assumes many faces. It is simultaneously the talisman of doomsday, a technological marriage between man and machine, a mature staple already intertwined within society, and an exciting new frontier of computation promising to solve problems previously unimaginable. It polarizes and draws a frenzy, obscuring the evaluation of progress in the field. In a world mired by technological progress at an increasingly ambivalent cost to the world, artificial intelligence promises profound advances simultaneously toward a greater society and the threat of a technocratic wasteland. It epitomizes the idea that technological advancement without caution poses catastrophic risks. Despite this, I remain hopeful that proper safety protocols can neuter adversarial artificial intelligence and facilitate benevolent applications of artificial intelligence. 

AI eludes an easy definition. Theoretically, elementary artificial intelligence is nothing more than a machine-optimized applied statistical model. For pragmatists, artificial intelligence derives its name from its unique capabilities compared to other computational methods, particularly when finding solutions to “human” problems. These are just two approaches - unfortunately, artificial intelligence fits many shoes depending on the context in which it exists. My definition relies upon a computational interpretation: artificial intelligence emulates “human thinking,” using computational, statistical, and neural techniques to solve “human” problems. The specific problem that a program intends to solve does not qualify whether it may be called AI. Rather, it is the approach the program takes and whether that approach is itself neural or intelligent in some manner that defines artificial intelligence. Importantly, AI may take on more primitive forms (advanced statistical and predictive models) to more substantial applications (such as generative AI), which vary in form, function, and usability. 

Despite its advances, AI poses a unique threat to my status quo. AI seeks to make human decisions without the accountability that comes with humans. Paired with its obscure and obfuscated “thought process,” it can be hazardous when used irresponsibly. For example, robots seek to replace blue-collar workers in manufacturing. Generative AI holds the potential to replace many forms of white-collar work. Facial recognition AI often inadvertently serves the surveillance apparatus of authoritarian regimes. Traditional predictive AI models regularly reinforce systemic inequalities when deployed without care, an eerily common occurrence. The irresponsible proliferation of AI has begun with little to no thought for repercussions: massive intellectual property theft underlies much of the effort to collect training data for AI. Haphazard AI proliferation has skyrocketed energy usage for applications without justification for the resource usage demanded by AI algorithms. 

Venture capital, government expenditure, energy investments, and more have served to further muddy the waters by injecting profound amounts of capital into the field. Under the guise of supporting such an innovative technology, this inadvertently changes the direction of AI from a scientific pursuit to a commercial pursuit. Before the advent of commercial generative AI, AI safety was one of the most popular philosophical discussions in academic fields with extensively documented media coverage. Extreme profit incentives at all non-monetary costs encumber the velocity of its advancements, the nature of its applications, and efforts to ensure safety. Profitability holds it hostage. Even academics must orient their studies in this direction to ensure continued funding. As a result, nowhere near the level of caution and safety often put into developing new technology has been allocated towards AI. 

And yet, AI is still the cutting edge of technology. It is neither a force of evil nor good, no matter how adversarial the application. Progress never walks backward; technology is a tool we must master. I have and will continue to make great efforts to understand AI models and the many intricacies by which they operate. Even with the advent of ChatGPT and commercial generative artificial intelligence, I was excited to explore its newfound ability to mock thinking and anthropic speech patterns. Artificial intelligence underlies substantial advancements in scientific research. Regardless, the cloud of excitement surrounding it has obscured its progress. So, we watch on in fear, hope, and dreary anticipation of a new future inseparable from the influence of artificial intelligence.
