## Overview

Memoria was my team and I's submission to HackMIT 2024 in Boston, MA from 9/14 to 9/15. I attended with Eva Cullen, a Columbia student, and two other Columbia students. 
Together, we developed an application called Memoria with a variety of mind games to help Alzheimers patients manage their disease in a gamified manner. 
This project earned **3rd place** for OrbStack's unique use of containers. 

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS**: Main front-end framework stack. 
- **Convex and Clerk**: React backend frameworks who both sponsored HackMIT. 
- **Tune.ai**: For LLM Integration.
