## Overview
In light of the threat Shor's Algorithm (and Regev's Algorithm, which speeds up Shor's by an algorithmic factor), 
the US government and many other implicated stakeholders have begun to pay more attention to the threat posed by 
quantum computers towards modern encryption. Recently, NIST designated Kyber as the backend of a slew of communication
protocols promising resistance to the threats posed to encryption by quantum computing. I, along with Cooper Lee, 
 researched the effectiveness of Kyber with large payloads, a key use-case for any reasonable large-scale migration 
 to a post-quantum future, finding that the existing algorithms are inefficient in their current state and infeasible
  to be used with larger payloads. 

## Motivations
Cryptography is what led me to discover the world of Quantum Computing. I stumbled upon the idea for this research project 
while exploring the recent developments in post-quantum cryptography, namely the standardization of Kyber in particular. 
Intriguied, I wanted to explore the ramifications and possible use cases given that the government was beginning to take an active role
in the post-quantum cryptographic race. After exploring a variety of avenues, I came to big data being the most exciting
exploration I could pursue on the edge (I originally wanted to explore embedded applications, but this is quite a saturated field). 

## Technical Writing
The largest challenge of this project was surprisingly not the technology (I learned a lot of C++!) but communicating my findings
to a non-technical audience.  

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Writing standard, up-to-date specifications of both ECC-KEM (which comes standard in C++) and Kyber KEM (the newly standardized post-quantum algorithm). 
- **Docker, Linux**: Testing each cipher in a sterile and fair testing environment.
