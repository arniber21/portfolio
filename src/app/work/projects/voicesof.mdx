## Overview

I designed and developed a website for The Voices of Equity, a non-profit organization dedicated towards furthering engagement and awareness of inequity in healthcare and raising a generation of professionals dedicated to eradicating health inequity. 
Caleb Suh, the founder of the organization, is a close friend of mine.
