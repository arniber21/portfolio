## Overview

CMSx is Cornell University's enterprise-scale Course Management System, developed and maintained entirely in-house by the CS department. What started as an internal tool has evolved into a robust, distributed platform that serves over 10,000 concurrent users across Cornell's Computer Science department and expanding into other technical departments.

The platform represents a sophisticated full-stack application built to handle the complex demands of academic course management at scale, from assignment distribution and grading workflows to compliance with educational regulations like FERPA.

## Technical Architecture

CMSx is built on a modern, hybrid architecture that balances legacy stability with cutting-edge performance:

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Java backend** powered by Jakarta EE with custom JPA layers optimized for concurrent request handling
- **High-throughput database architecture** with transaction optimizations at critical API endpoints
- **Custom concurrency handling** designed to manage peak load conditions during assignment deadlines
- **Performance engineering** achieving 14% improvements in database transaction speeds

### Frontend Systems
- **Dual frontend architecture** serving different user needs:
  - **Legacy JSP frontend** handling critical course staff functionality and legal compliance requirements
  - **Modern React/TypeScript frontend** providing mobile-friendly, intuitive student interfaces
- **Responsive design** optimized for both desktop and mobile academic workflows

### Key Features
- **Enterprise-scale rubric grading system** (10,000+ lines of code)
- **FERPA-compliant data handling** for student privacy protection
- **Real-time assignment management** for concurrent user loads
- **Cross-platform compatibility** ensuring accessibility across devices

## My Contributions

As a Software Engineer on the CMSx team, I focus on backend optimization, feature development, and system modernization:

### Performance Engineering
- Engineered high-throughput backend optimizations achieving up to **14% performance improvements**
- Implemented database transaction optimizations at critical API endpoints
- Enhanced error handling across Java and Jakarta EE services under peak load conditions
- Designed custom JPA concurrency handling for 10,000+ concurrent users

### Enterprise Feature Development
- Architected and shipped comprehensive rubric grading system spanning **10,000+ lines of code**
- Seamlessly integrated new features with legacy JSP infrastructure and modern React frontend
- Ensured compliance with FERPA regulations and academic requirements throughout development
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and iterate on features

### System Modernization
- Overhauled API request patterns between React frontend and Java backend
- Implemented newer technologies to improve application responsiveness and platform engagement
- Developed end-to-end testing frameworks for critical user workflows
- **Actively porting legacy JSP code to modern React components** while maintaining system reliability

### Quality Assurance
- Established comprehensive testing practices including E2E test development
- Consulted on UX improvements to enhance student and faculty experience
- Maintained compliance with academic regulations throughout modernization efforts
