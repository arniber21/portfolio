## Overview

CMSx is the Course Managment Software (CMS) used by Cornell University's CS department. It was developed in-house and continues to be developed in-house. 
Slowly, it has become the dominant course software within the CS department. Other departments tangentially related to the CS department have begun to expand their use of CMSx as well.
