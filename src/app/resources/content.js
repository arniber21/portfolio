  I'm Arnab Ghosh, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Cornell University with a passion for building robust software systems that drive scientific research and deliver practical impact. My experience spans backend architecture, full-stack development, and AI-driven solutions, with a focus on unifying and scaling tools for quantum computing and next-generation platforms.
  <br /><br />
  At HRL Laboratories, I design and develop Python-based systems that bridge research and engineering. My work includes building full-stack applications for data accessibility, architecting DevOps pipelines, and creating infrastructure that unifies research workflowsâ€”helping accelerate quantum computing projects by 30%. From streamlining data pipelines to integrating automated testing and deployment, I focus on creating seamless, reliable, and scalable platforms for cutting-edge research.
  <br /><br />
  At Cornell CMSX, I enhance system reliability for 2,000+ students by developing backend services in Java and Jakarta EE, seamlessly integrated with React and TypeScript frontends. My work improves academic tools through modular design, performance optimizations, and user-focused features.
  <br /><br />
  Beyond professional roles, I've led impactful projects like Neurosphere (1st place, MongoDB, HackTech 2025) and Memoria (3rd place, OrbStack, HackMIT 2024), blending AI models and intuitive interfaces to solve real-world problems. As Education Lead at the Cornell Quantum Computing Association, I create learning materials and host events like the Qiskit Fall Fest to make quantum computing more approachable for students.
  <br /><br />
  I'm excited to bring my skills in backend systems, full-stack development, and infrastructure engineering to teams building transformative technology in quantum computing, AI, and beyond.
