  I'm Arnab Ghosh, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Cornell University with a passion for building robust software systems that drive scientific research and deliver practical impact. My experience spans backend architecture, full-stack development, and AI-driven solutions, with a focus on high-performance systems and scalable infrastructure for cutting-edge platforms.
  <br /><br />
  At HRL Laboratories, I architect and maintain critical full-stack applications for quantum computing research infrastructure using Python and Vue.js. My work includes improving application performance by 50% through Redis integration, leading containerization efforts with Docker and nginx, and implementing secure AI solutionsâ€”all while collaborating with cross-functional research teams to streamline experimental workflows.
  <br /><br />
  At Cornell CMSx, I engineer high-throughput backend optimizations for a distributed course management platform serving 10,000+ concurrent users. Working with Java, Jakarta EE, and React/TypeScript, I've achieved 14% performance improvements through database optimization and custom JPA concurrency handling, while modernizing legacy systems and shipping enterprise-scale features spanning 10,000+ lines of code.
  <br /><br />
  Beyond professional roles, I've led impactful projects like Neurosphere (1st place, MongoDB, HackTech 2025) and Memoria (3rd place, OrbStack, HackMIT 2024), blending AI models and intuitive interfaces to solve real-world problems. As Education Lead at the Cornell Quantum Computing Association, I create learning materials and host events like the Qiskit Fall Fest to make quantum computing more approachable for students.
  <br /><br />
  I'm excited to bring my skills in backend systems, full-stack development, and infrastructure engineering to teams building transformative technology in quantum computing, AI, and beyond.
